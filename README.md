# Patient Pathway Analysis (KNIME Workflow)

## Objective
This project analyzes patient diagnostic test data to uncover:
- Trends in testing volume and costs over time.  
- City-wise distribution of diagnostic tests.  

It demonstrates how KNIME workflows can be applied to healthcare data for better insights, supporting data-driven decision-making in patient diagnostics and treatment pathways.

---

## Workflow
The workflow processes patient and test datasets, joins them, extracts date fields, groups the data, and visualizes results.

## Steps
1. **Load Data**: Import patient and test datasets (CSV Readers).  
2. **Join Data**: Combine patient and test data.  
3. **Date Processing**: Convert dates and extract Yearâ€“Month.  
4. **Aggregation**: Group data to compute monthly summaries.  
5. **Visualization**:  
   - ðŸ“ˆ **Line Plot** â†’ Monthly test counts and costs.  
   - ðŸ“Š **Bar Chart** â†’ City-wise test cost comparison.  
   - ðŸ¥§ **Pie Chart** â†’ Distribution of tests across cities.

## Tech Stack
- **KNIME Analytics Platform**  
- **CSV Data Processing**  
- **Data Visualization** (Line Plot, Bar Chart, Pie Chart)  

---

## Real-World Relevance
This project simulates how diagnostic test data can be transformed into actionable insights.  
It reflects workflows used in **precision medicine** and **clinical decision support**, where trends in testing help optimize healthcare costs and patient outcomes.
